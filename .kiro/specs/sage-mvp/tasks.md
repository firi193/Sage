- [x] 3. Build Key Management Service





  - Implement KeyManager class with store_key, _retrieve_key_for_proxy, and list_keys methods
  - Add key ownership validation and metadata management
  - Create unit tests for key lifecycle operations
  - Implement key rotation and revocation functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6_

- [x] 4. Create Authorization Engine





  - Implement AccessGrant creation and validation logic
  - Build authorization checking mechanism for caller permissions
  - Add grant expiration handling and cleanup processes
  - Write unit tests for grant lifecycle and authorization checks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 5. Implement Policy Engine for rate limiting





  - Create usage tracking and rate limit enforcement

  - Implement per-caller per-key rate limiting logic
  - Add unit tests for rate limiting scenarios
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6_

- [x] 6. Build Privacy-Aware Logging Service



  - Implement logging with metadata only (method, endpoint, payload size, response time)
  - Create tamper-resistant chronological log storage
  - Add log querying and filtering capabilities
  - Write unit tests for logging functionality and privacy protection
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

- [x] 7. Implement Coral MCP Interface with integrated proxy

















  - Create MCP protocol handler for Coral agent communication
  - Implement session validation using Coral session/wallet IDs
  - Build HTTP client for external API calls with key injection
  - Add request/response handling with performance tracking
  - Write unit tests for MCP protocol compliance and proxy functionality
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 8. Integrate all services into main SageMCP class














  - Wire together all components (KeyManager, AuthorizationEngine, PolicyEngine, etc.)
  - Implement the four main methods: add_key, grant_access, proxy_call, list_logs
  - Add comprehensive error handling and Coral-compatible error responses
  - Emphasize privacy-aware logging and secure error handling as core differentiators
  - Create integration tests for complete workflows
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.5, 3.6_

- [ ] 9. Build critical end-to-end test scenarios
  - Create mock Coral agents for testing
  - Prioritize core flow: Agent A stores key → grants access to Agent B → Agent B makes calls → revoke → rate limit
  - Test complete audit trail and log filtering functionality
  - Focus on critical flows over exhaustive testing for MVP
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 10. Add FastAPI web server (MVP deployment)
  - Create FastAPI application to host the Sage MCP service
  - Implement health check and status endpoints
  - Add basic security headers for local development
  - _Requirements: 6.1_

- [ ] 11. Create demonstration and validation scripts
  - Build demo script showing Agent A and Agent B interaction
  - Create validation script to verify all acceptance criteria
  - Document API usage examples and integration guide
  - _Requirements: All requirements demonstration_

- [ ] 12. Stretch goals (if time permits)
  - Add HTTPS configuration for production readiness
  - Create Docker containerization for easy deployment
  - Add performance testing for concurrent requests
  - Implement advanced retry logic and circuit breakers
